# My First Project

This is my first project on the odin project course. My task is to create a web page about recipes using html.
<p>During working on this project I have practiced the basic html elements like using the paragraph element, strong element, making ordered and unordered lists, adding pictures and creating links within my code <p>
<p> I have also practiced how to commit and push the changes I make in the code to git hub, and how to make short and precise comments about my changes that will be usefull to me and to anyone else that might look at my code <p>
