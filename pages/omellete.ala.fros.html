        <h1>Omellete ala Fros</h1>
        <p>This is a simple omellete with a few extra ingredinets to make for a full meal. It's quick and easy to make, perfect for the time we live in, where half of us are too busy and the other half are too lazy to make something that requires more than 20 minutes of your time. And a lot of us are both! If this is you, but you still want to eat better than a hobbo or a college student, this is the right recipe for you. </p>
